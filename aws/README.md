# Lacework Terraform Provisioning for AWS
Terraform modules that create AWS resources required to integrate AWS accounts with the Lacework Cloud Security Platform.

## AWS Config and CloudTrail Integration Overview
In order for Lacework to monitor AWS configuration and CloudTrail activity, the following must be configured for each AWS account:

#### Required Resources
- **Cross Account IAM Role** - Delegate access to Lacework to monitor resource configurations within customer's AWS account. This role is used for both the Config and CloudTrail Integrations
  - `SecurityAudit` Policy - AWS managed policy used to allow Lacework to assess configuration metadata. Policy is applied for configuration assessment only.
  - Custom IAM Policy - Delegate access to Lacework to monitor CloudTrail Activity. Policy is attached to the IAM role when CloudTrail is configured.
- **CloudTrail** - Create a new CloudTrail Trail or use an existing Trail
  - **S3 Bucket** - Used to store CloudTrail logs. Create a new S3 bucket, or use an existing bucket
  - **SNS Topic** - Used to send notifications when CloudTrail publishes new log files to the configured S3 bucket. Use an existing or create a new SNS topic.
  - **SQS Queue** - SQS queue subscribed to CloudTrail SNS topic used by Lacework to ingest CloudTrail logs
- **Lacework AWS CFG Integration** - Configures AWS CFG integration between Lacework and customer AWS account
- **Lacework AWS CT Integration** - Configures AWS CT integration between Lacework and customer AWS account

## Requirements
Before you begin the following must be configured on the workstation running Terraform

- [Terraform](terraform.io/downloads.html) `v0.12.x`
- [AWS API Access Key, Secret Access Key](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/)
- [Lacework API Key](https://support.lacework.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011403853-Generate-API-Access-Keys-and-Tokens)

Typically, the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) will have been previously installed and `aws configure` run and with `$AWS_PROFILE` set to the appropriate credential profile in `~/.aws/credentials`

Also recommend that the [Lacework CLI](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk) be installed and the `[default]` profile is associated with the applicable Lacework Account `api_key` and `api_secret` in `~/.lacework.toml`

## Usage

### Enable New CloudTrail Configuration
This example creates a new CloudTrail Trail, an IAM Role for Lacework, and then configures both integrations with Lacework

```hcl
provider "aws" {}

provider "lacework" {}

module "aws_config" {
  source = "github.com/lacework/terraform-provisioning/aws/modules/config"
}

module "aws_cloudtrail" {
  source                = "github.com/lacework/terraform-provisioning/aws/modules/cloudtrail"
  bucket_force_destroy  = true
  use_existing_iam_role = true
  iam_role_name         = module.aws_config.iam_role_name
  iam_role_external_id  = module.aws_config.external_id
}
```

### Integrate Existing CloudTrail Without SNS Delivery with Lacework
This example uses an existing CloudTrail Trail and S3 bucket passed as inputs to the module. The example creates the SNS topic, SQS queue, and IAM Role for Lacework, and then configures both integrations with Lacework.
```hcl
provider "aws" {}

provider "lacework" {}

module "aws_config" {
  source = "github.com/lacework/terraform-provisioning/aws/modules/config"
}

module "aws_cloudtrail" {
  source = "github.com/lacework/terraform-provisioning/aws/modules/cloudtrail"

  use_existing_cloudtrail = true
  bucket_name             = "lacework-ct-bucket-8805c0bf"

  use_existing_iam_role = true
  iam_role_name         = module.aws_config.iam_role_name
  iam_role_external_id  = module.aws_config.external_id
}
```

**NOTE: This example does not modify your CloudTrail, therefore, you have to enable SNS delivery notifications manually and point to the generated SNS topic.**

### Integrate Existing CloudTrail With SNS Delivery Enabled with Lacework
This example uses an existing CloudTrail, S3 bucket, and SNS topic passed as inputs to the module. The example creates the SQS queue and IAM Role for Lacework, and then configures both integrations with Lacework.
```hcl
provider "aws" {}

provider "lacework" {}

module "aws_config" {
  source = "github.com/lacework/terraform-provisioning/aws/modules/config"
}

module "aws_cloudtrail" {
  source = "github.com/lacework/terraform-provisioning/aws/modules/cloudtrail"

  use_existing_cloudtrail = true
  bucket_name             = "lacework-ct-bucket-8805c0bf"
  sns_topic_name          = "lacework-ct-sns-8805c0bf"

  use_existing_iam_role = true
  iam_role_name         = module.aws_config.iam_role_name
  iam_role_external_id  = module.aws_config.external_id
}
```

**NOTE: This example assumes that your CloudTrail is already sending delivery notifications to the provided SNS topic.**

### Enable New Consolidated CloudTrail Configuration
This example enables a new Consolidated CloudTrail and IAM Role for Lacework, then configures both integrations with Lacework.
Finally, it configures a new CloudTrail Trail in an AWS sub-account that points to the main CloudTrail.

```hcl
provider "lacework" {
  alias = "main"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias = "main"
}

module "main_cloudtrail" {
  source    = "github.com/lacework/terraform-provisioning/aws/modules/cloudtrail"
  providers = {
    aws      = aws.main
    lacework = lacework.main
  }
  consolidated_trail = true
}

provider "aws" {
  alias = "sub_account"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "lw_sub_account_cloudtrail" {
  provider              = aws.sub_account
  name                  = "lacework-sub-trail"
  is_multi_region_trail = true
  s3_bucket_name        = module.main_cloudtrail.bucket_name
  sns_topic_name        = module.main_cloudtrail.sns_arn
}
```
